<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year PhD student at Harbin Engineering University. Prior that, I have reveived the M.S. degree from Harbin Engineering University in Mar 2022. Also, I work as a Research Assistant at <a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html'>IMCL lab</a> in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Prof.<a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/'>Jiannong Cao</a> and Dr.<a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~shanjiang/'>Shan Jiang</a>.

My research interest includes Collaborative Edge Computing, Distributed machine learning, Federated Learning, and Blockchain.

I am open to academic collaborations and welcome discussions concerning potential researchpartnerships.
